# pimatelogger
This is my try at a climate logger script that runs on a Raspberry Pi

# What it does
It reads the Temperature and Humidity values from a Sensor like the DHT22, stores it in an RRD file and generates the appropriate graphs.

# What you need
- a Raspberry Pi
- a DHT22 or similar Sensor
- the corresponding driver installed

# Installation

# Configuration
